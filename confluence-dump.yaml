# This config file serves as the "documentation" for confluence-dump.  I promise i'll talk about all
# the tweakables here.  By default the tool will expect this file in ~/.config/confluence-dump.yaml,
# but you can specify where to find it with the CONFLUENCE_DUMP_CONFIG environment variable, or with
# the --config flag when executing confluence-dump.

## Settings
#
# Always redownload / rewrite files to filesystem, even if they look up-to-date.  Useful if you're
# monkeying with the Markdown output format.
#
# (default: false)
# always-download: true

# VCR replays API requests.  If you enable it, the first request will hit the API server, subsequent
# requests will be served lightning-fast from your local.  Definitely *do not* commit the VCR file,
# it probably contains all your company's secrets.
#
# Note that if something went wrong, you might have a cached response in the "cassettes" that you
# don't want.  Just trash the fixtures/ folder and try again.
#
# (default: false)
# with-vcr: true

# Grab all available spaces, rather than relying on the list in `spaces`.  This option will take
# precedence over anything configured in `spaces`.  It can cause a large amount of downloading to
# happen.
#
# (default: false)
# all-spaces: true

# Delete Markdown files in the local dump that we don't recognise or that have been renamed/moved on
# Confluence.  You'll almost always want this, so that moved files don't cause duplicated IDs, which
# is a mess.  We'll only ever touch spaces you've asked to sync, so you can reasonably update a
# single space on command with pruning enabled.
#
# (default: true)
# prune: true

# If you don't want to hammer the file system, this gives you a "dry run" where it performs all
# steps except the final "write markdown to disk" step.
#
# (default: true)
# write-markdown: true

# Provide a list of keys of spaces to synchronise from your Confluence wiki.  By default, none will
# be synchronised, so you probably do want to set this to youre favourite spaces.  You can find
# spaces' keys with the `confluence-dump list spaces` command.
#
# (default: [])
spaces:
  - CORE
  - DRE
  - ENG2

# Confluence treats blog posts and pages separately.  We usually only grab pages, but if you also
# want blog posts, this is for you.  Flick this switch to get/not get blog posts downloaded.
#
# (default: false)
include-blogposts: true

# Toggle whether to download archived content, or only current content.  (Currently we don't support
# downloading deleted or trashed content, but that wouldn't be too hard.. famous last words..)
#
# (default: false)
include-archived: false

# Configure your API connection to Confluence.  You'll need to get hold of an API token at
# https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens, then store it safely.  Then, provide
# your Atlassian username in `auth-username`, and provide a command to run to retrieve your API
# token in `auth-token-cmd`.  I use the https://www.passwordstore.org/ tool to do that.
#
# auth-token-cmd is a list with the binary to execute as its first element, and all arguments as
# separate list items after that.
auth-username: paul.david@redbubble.com
auth-token-cmd:
  - pass
  - confluence-api-token/paul.david@redbubble.com

# Where to keep your downloaded Markdown version of Confluence wiki.  Folders and files will be
# created like ~/confluence/ORG/SPACE/page/ancestor/123-title.md
#
# (required; no default)
store: ~/confluence

# The name of your Confluence instance.  You can find this in the URL of your Confluence pages, as
# the subdomain to atlassian.net.
#
# Maybe one day this will be a list.
#
# (required; no default)
confluence-instance: redbubble

# post-download-cmd will run a command after a successful download action.  This might be useful to
# fulltext-index your local Confluence dump, or .. whatever!  PWD for the command will be your
# `store` path configured above, so commands will be run as if they're invoked from within your
# Confluence Markdown storage location.
#
# (default: []; no command will be run)
post-download-cmd:
  - touch
  - .projectile
